# DataViz_project

## Overview
Tried to visualize how I analyze a large dataset.

## Project Description
I got a task to visualize a data set of 2100 assets around New York. Data about the assets include an identifier, physical location, metadata, and a hazard (effectively, a failure probability).

As the data contains latitude and longitude so first I plotted all of them on a map and then I filtered out and highlighted the required ones. Clicking on the highlighted marker will showcase the data associated with it in the form of a graph.

## How to run the project?
Clone the repo and navigate to that repo using the terminal. Now use the "npm install" to add the pre-requisite. Then start the node server for that project and visit the respective URL to see the working dashboard.
